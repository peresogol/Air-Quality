# Qualit'Air


## Description
Qualit'Air (name has changed) is an Android application made for a school project by Jonathan BONNEFOY and Sacha CAULI (myself). The purpose of this app is to know the air quality of the place where you are. Once the app has geolocated you, it will display the main pollutant and the air quality index (the us one) of your area. The app is also able to display the actual weather (forecast isn't available because we use a community version of an API). You can also check your search history, and add a location to your favorite places.


## Android emulator version 
App is build using Pixel 2 API 28 Android 9.0 (Pie) Google Play Intel Atom (x86).
